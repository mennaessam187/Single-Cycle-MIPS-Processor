Single-Cycle Processor Design in VHDL ðŸ˜ŽðŸš€

Our project focuses on designing a Single-Cycle Processor using VHDL. The processor supports both R-type and I-type instructions.

*R-type Instructions
-Add: Perform addition.
-Sub: Perform subtraction.
-And: Perform bitwise AND.
-Or: Perform bitwise OR.
-Nand: Perform bitwise NAND.
-Slt: Set on less than.
*I-type Instructions
-Load word (lw): Load a word from memory.
-Store word (sw): Store a word to memory.
-Add immediate (addi): Add immediate value to a register.
-Branch equal (beq): Branch if registers are equal.
-Branch not equal (bne): Branch if registers are not equal.
